# GitHub Repository Exporter for LLM Context

This Jupyter Notebook provides a script to clone a GitHub repository, process its contents, and export all non-image files as a single text file. The generated file can be used to add context for a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, making it easier to understand and work with the repository's code and documentation.

## Features

- **Clone and Process a Repository**: Automatically clones a specified GitHub repository into the Colab environment.
- **Filter Out Unnecessary Files**: Excludes Git-related files (e.g., `.git` directory contents) and image files from the output.
- **README at the Top**: Places the repository's README file at the top of the output for contextual overview.
- **Single Output File**: Combines all relevant text-based files into a single `.txt` file, which is saved to Google Drive for easy access.
- **LLM Context**: The output file is designed to be used as context for an LLM, making it easier to assist with tasks related to the repository's code and structure.
